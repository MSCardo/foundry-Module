/>\n<h3>Your Pact Boon</h3>\n<p>Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron's nature.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pact of the Chain. </strong></em>Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with imps and quasits tied to the Fiend.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pact of the Blade. </strong></em>If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Pact of the Tome. </strong></em>Your Book of Shadows could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Otherworldly Patrons</h1>\n<p>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.</p>\n<p>Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock.

style=\"font-weight:400\">This archetype focuses on the ability to design, craft, and utilize powerful, yet dangerous ranged weapons. Through creative innovation and immaculate aim, you become a distant force of death on the battlefield. However, not being a perfect science, firearms carry an inherent instability that can occasionally leave you without a functional means of attack. This is the danger of new, untested technologies in a world where the arcane energies that rule the elements are ever present. </span></p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Firearm Proficiency</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with firearms, allowing you to add your proficiency bonus to attacks made with firearms. </span></p>\n\n<p><b>Gunsmith</b></p>\n<p>Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with Tinker’s Tools. You may use them to craft ammunition at half the cost, repair damaged firearms, or even draft and create new ones (DM’s discretion). Some extremely experimental and intricate firearms are only available through crafting.</p>\n<h5><strong>Firearm Properties</strong></h5>\n<p>Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Reload.</em></strong> The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Misfire.</strong></em> Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Explosive.</strong></em> Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.</p>\n<h5><strong>Ammunition</strong></h5>\n<p>All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature}, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase.

Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.</p>\n<h5>Firearms</h5>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Cost</th>\n<th>Ammo</th>\n<th>Damage</th>\n<th>Weight</th>\n<th>Range</th>\n<th>Properties</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Palm Pistol</td>\n<td>50g</td>\n<td>2g (20)</td>\n<td>1d8 piercing</td>\n<td>1 lb.</td>\n<td>(40/160)</td>\n<td>\n<div>Light, reload 1, misfire 1</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pistol</td>\n<td>150g</td>\n<td>4g (20)</td>\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\n<td>3 lb.</td>\n<td>(60/240)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 4, misfire 1</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Musket</td>\n<td>300g</td>\n<td>5g (20)</td>\n<td>1d12 piercing</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n<td>(120/480)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 2</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pepperbox</td>\n<td>250g</td>\n<td>4g (20)</td>\n<td>1d10 piercing</td>\n<td>5 lb.</td>\n<td>(80/320)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 6, misfire 2</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blunderbuss</td>\n<td>300g</td>\n<td>5g (5)</td>\n<td>2d8 piercing</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n<td>(15/60)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 2</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bad News</td>\n<td>Crafted</td>\n<td>10g (5)</td>\n<td>2d12 piercing</td>\n<td>25 lb.</td>\n<td>(200/800)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Two-handed, reload 1, misfire 3</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hand Mortar</td>\n<td>Crafted</td>\n<td>10g (1)</td>\n<td>2d8 fire</td>\n<td>10 lb.</td>\n<td>(30/60)</td>\n<td>\n<div>\n<div>Reload 1, misfire 3, explosive</div>\n</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Fighter : Gunslinger","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":null,"attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"vg8j7L95mcsJuw7y":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":39826,"type":"class","dndbeyond":{"requiredLevel":3,"displayOrder":2,"levelScale":null,"levelScales":[],"limitedUse":[],"class":"Fighter : Gunslinger"},"class":"Fighter","subclass":"Gunslinger","importId":"flisxqqyxmbyqhjx"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Fighter"}}}},{"_id":"W1gEXA5i0Gnx02UZ","name":"Trick Shots: Dazing Shot","type":"feat","img":"icons/weapons/guns/gun-pistol-wood.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">These trick shots are presented in alphabetical order.<br /></span></p><h3>Dazing Shot</h3><p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">When you make a firearm attack against a creature, you can expend one grit point to attempt to dizzy your opponent.

druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n<h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>\n<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.rules\" data-id=\"2JNtWRo7wMq08bXn\"> appendix PH-B</a> include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.</p>\n<h1>Druid Circles</h1>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.4Ae2SPZRXEVbVs0M]{Circle of the Land}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"druid","levels":6,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"6pdotglp4hy4zlvb","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.LzJ5ayHt0OlSVGxi","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.i6tPm3FNK13Ftc9v"]},"value":{"added":{"t3q7lkrj5hpq8fti":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.LzJ5ayHt0OlSVGxi","1taqqqmthxp1mlke":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.i6tPm3FNK13Ftc9v"}},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"qnfy6m18u4cfdqwm","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.swK0r5TOIxredxWS","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi"]},"value":{"added":{"r5af177956jgb09c":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.swK0r5TOIxredxWS","q5uvj13kjld0geum":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.u6Du2P9s81SWuGbi"}},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"r3xhzsz7noff50w3","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.cVDEQo0ow1WJT7Wl","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.xvgPu1O57DgXCM86"]},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"pkfb1a2u37665epq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ip4bvmGoz3qkoqes"]},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"qv0gbr1rb5889ubd","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":8,"3":4,"4":5,"5":6,"6":2},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"6vytnom37pkazgld","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"wild-shape","type":"number","scale":{"2":{"value":0.25},"4":{"value":0.5},"8":{"value":1}}},"value":{},"title":"Wild Shape CR","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","ani","ins","med","nat","prc","rel","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"attunement":null},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Xg62HuZbXuesq035":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.ygVYgPbJkaH0tH1N"}}},{"_id":"t3q7lkrj5hpq8fti","name":"Druidic","type":"feat","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/core/icons/sundries/documents/document-torn-diagram-tan.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids.

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.

A családban a lakatos foglalkozás száll apáról fiúra. Riddle is itt született és nevelkedett átlagos tabaxikent. Riddle édesanyja néhány éve halt meg betegségben. Egy lánytestvére van Blossom akivel nagyon jó kapcsolatot ápol. Sajnos Blossom nem érezte jól magát a nagyvárosban ezért 18 éves korában útnak indult a világba jelenleg fogalma sincs Riddlenek merre járhat. Így ketten maradtak édesapjával akire példaképként tekintett. Gyerekkorában Apjának minden nap segített a munkájában hogy egy nap beszálljon a családi üzletbe. A családban volt egy hagyomány. Riddle egyik felmenője valahogyan hozzájutott egy puzzle boxhoz ami a szóbeszédek alapján egy rendkívüli kincset rejt. Ezt a puzzle boxot a család elsőszülött fia örökli meg 20 éves korában. Riddle látta már apját ahogy dolgozik a boxon és alig várta hogy ő is megpróbálhassa feltörni a kincs rejtekét. 20 éves korában meg is kapta lévén egyedüli fiú volt. Sok sok napot töltött azzal hogy megértse a box működését. 6 éve telt el. Közben élte minden napos életét dolgozott az apjával, kereste a szerelmet kutatott a doboz titka után. Ám egy nap ő maga sem érti hogyan de sikerült feltörnie az összes zárat. Egy zsebóra volt benne. Amint megérintette érezte hogy nem egy szokványos óra. Érezte hogy átjárja valamiféle erő. A  közeli varazsló toronyban megtudta hogy ez egy ereklye Primustol és csak egy különleges egyén tudja használni amikor annak eljön az ideje. Viszont az óra még nem érte el a teljes erejét mivel még nem működik minden alkatrésze. A varázsló toronyban elmondták neki hogy ne féljen érezni fogja hogyan kell használnia az órát de hogy hogyan aknazhatja ki a teljes erejét azt ők sem tudják. Ezért Riddle elindult a Hupperdook városba hogy megmutassa az órát apja barátjának hátha tud segíteni neki beindítani az óra többi részét. A barát elmondta neki hogy hallott már az óra legendajarol és csak a kivalasztott tudja hogy hogyan kell beindítani az órát.</p><p>Riddle elcsuggedt mert egyáltalán nem érezte hogy tudna a valaszokat. betért hát a fogadóba hogy gondolkozzon azon vajon miért ő a kiválasztott, mit kezdjen újdonsült erejével és mit tartogat számára a sors.</p></section>\n<hr /><section><p><strong>Allies &amp; Organizations :</strong> </p><p>Blossom - Lánytestvér, nem tudni hol van, megunta a városi létet</p><p>Hidden Mark - Apja, Büszkévé akarja tenni azzal, hogy megfejti az óra titkát</p><p>Primus - ?</p></section>\n<hr /><section><p><strong>Treasure :</strong> </p><p>A clockwork watch</p></section>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral","race":"Tabaxi","background":"Guild Artisan","originalClass":"","xp":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":14000,"pct":-86.66666666666667},"appearance":"","trait":"I always want to know how things work and what makes people tick.","ideal":"Nem tudom miért kaptam az erőt de tudni akarom hogy meddig juthatok. \nLogic.
